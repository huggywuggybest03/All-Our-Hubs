So, these are all stuff that you can use!
I will be making some more exploit hubs and other stuff for you to use, this is the repository I will update regurally. None of the others will.
The our-hub will be soon updated to have new stuff, as you are begging!
And also we just updated 4 stuff, added libraries.lua to make your own scripts!
We have a youtube channel based off from this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpWJUc1nF4Fa7P3QdvSnJ3A

* I'm sorry for not updating this much, I am just focusing on my life and other stuff right now, so I will update this monthly or weekly if I get time.
* I was working on some more coding, but now our views on this github repository have skyrocketed down. I'll try my best to keep this up.
